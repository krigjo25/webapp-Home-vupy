'description': 'In gloria excelcious deo, everyone. I hope that your day is as beautiful as you are.\n\nToday i woke up at 05:30, which gave me 7 hour of sleep. I didnt manage to get to the GYM before at 06:10 as i started the day with the daily blog.  I drank about 1800ml water during this visit\n\nBench press\nNothibg to log today\n\nSquat\nThis log somehow got deleted.\n\n\nSkullcrusher - Triceps bar\nSome how the mind  is resisting this exercise, could it be as an consequence of being aggressive? It seems that rhe reaistment disappeard while focusing on the current task.\n\n\nHammer curl - Triceps bar\nThroughout the first set everything went fine, as it should do. Throughout the last set the mind decided to do it slower, and the mind realized that during this exercise the body do not breath, which makes the body stop a sec to catch the breath during this exercise, doing it slower made the body sense more resistments.\n\nI will head bak to the gym later today todo the efollowibg exercises : AB Wheeler, push ups and probably some jogging.\n\nAb Wheel - Assisted\nThrought out this exercise the body sensed the resistment through the abs. \n\n\nPush up üëäüèæ\nThrough the last reps i still sense the resistment,   the body senses its enough fkr a while loonger. \n\n\nHave a beautiful day, thank you for reading,\nfeedbacks are appreciated.\n@krigjo25',
