## Challanges

- Encountered a challange regarding sending content editable data to the server

I created a function containing ajax to send the information which was required to do the task.

- While looping through the contenteditable content
The challenge was solved by using a for loop to interate through the content and ensuring the values matches with the button value

- Encountered a problem with the form submission with the edit button

Which i tried to solve where the server fetches the clicked button and the data was processed through javascript.
There were another wqay, which was quite easier fetching the whole ajax content, and use it to gain the ability to edit the contenteditable text.
