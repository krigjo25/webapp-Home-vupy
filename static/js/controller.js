            web development, and I was introduced to JavaScript. While I
            explored JavaScript, I found my true calling in back-end
            development. I chose to specialize in Python and database
            management, gaining practical experience through Discord projects.
            To further my education, I am currently studying at getAcademy
            and CS50 at Harvard. I am excited to apply my skills to more
            complex projects and continue growing as a developer.

            As Developer i prefer to organize my code with comments, 
            to give out a greater understanding of the code which is
            written, I also prefer to organize my code with a
            documentation for a greater understanding of the project.
            My process of development includes a lot of simplicity at
            first, then I optimize the code for a better performance.
            Through my journey as a developer, I have learned that the
            best way to ensure the quality for the code is through test
            frameworks.
