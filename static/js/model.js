                    As an Application Engineer i prefer to organize my code with comments,

                written, I also prefer to organize my code with a
                documentation for a greater understanding of the project.
                My process of development includes a lot of simplicity at
                first, then I optimize the code for a better performance.
                Through my journey as a developer, I have learned that the
