                    As Developer i prefer to organize my code with comments, 
                    to give out a greater understanding of the code which is
                    written, I also prefer to organize my code with a
                    documentation for a greater understanding of the project.
                    My process of development includes a lot of simplicity at
                    first, then I optimize the code for a better performance.
                    Through my journey as a developer, I have learned that the
                    best way to ensure the quality for the code is through test
